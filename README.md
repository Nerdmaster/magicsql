magicsql
---

magicsql wraps database/sql types and functions in a way that can simplify
certain operations.

This is still a work in progress and I don't claim this package will be most
people's preferred approach.

Versions
---

This project will follow the Semantic Versioning specification, v2.0.0, and all
tags will be prefixed with "v" to allow [gb](https://getgb.io/) to pull this
package as an unvendored dependency.
